This initiative aims to simultaneously combat food waste and food insecurity, two pressing issues that frequently affect the same neighborhoods. Our approach focuses on creating a robust network that links surplus food providers—such as local restaurants, grocery stores, and food producers—with individuals and families experiencing food insecurity.

We will establish partnerships with these suppliers to collect surplus food that is still safe and nutritious but at risk of being discarded. Through an organized redistribution system, we’ll ensure that this food reaches those in need, helping to nourish communities while significantly reducing waste. Our goal is to create a sustainable model that not only alleviates hunger but also promotes environmental responsibility by making the most of available resources. By fostering collaboration between local businesses and community members, we aim to build a stronger, healthier community for everyone.
